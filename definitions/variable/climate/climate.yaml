    description: Global warming potential of {Level-3 Species} that is used for
      variables that have units of CO2-equivalents.
    unit: ""
    notes: It is not specified what period the GWP is calculated over (i.e.,
      whether it is GWP100, GWP20 or some other period). Modelers should use
      this variable to report whichever GWP has been used to calculate
      CO2-equivalent emissions in other variables.
