# Price|Carbon modified in IAM COMPACT, and alternative region-weightings were
# added. The modified definitions (relative to common-definitions) were taken
# from the openENTRANCE nomenclature repository.
- Price|Carbon:
    definition: Price of carbon (economy-wide, or average weighted by emissions)
    unit: [EUR_2017/t CO2, USD_2017/t CO2]
    region-aggregation:
        - Price|Carbon:
            weight: Emissions|CO2
            drop_negative_weights: False
        - Price|Carbon (weighted by Final Energy):
            weight: Final Energy
        - Price|Carbon (weighted by Electricity Demand):
            weight: Final Energy|Electricity

- Price|Carbon (weighted by Final Energy):
    definition: Price of carbon weighted across regions by final energy consumption
    notes: Using CO2 emissions as weights for average prices can cause spurious results
      when emissions are negative. This variable can be used as an alternative indicator
      for carbon prices which is less biased in low-carbon scenarios.
      This variable is computed as part of the region-processing from `Price|Carbon`.
    unit: [EUR_2017/t CO2, USD_2017/t CO2]
    skip-region-aggregation: true

- Price|Carbon (weighted by Electricity Demand):
    definition: Price of carbon weighted across regions by electricity demand
    notes: This variable can be used as an alternative indicator for carbon prices to
     bottom-up or partial equilibrium models that lack full energy system representation.
     This variable is computed as part of the region-processing from `Price|Carbon`.
    unit: [EUR_2017/t CO2, USD_2017/t CO2]
    skip-region-aggregation: true
